## i-Care

## Wireless Capsule Endoscopy
A platform for the analysis of the abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract. 

## COVID-19
COVID-19 is a global pandemic affecting millions of people worldwide. RT-PCR has been established as a standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We are providing an alternative method to diagnose COVID-19 using CT scans through AI algorithms. Our diagnosis pipeline consists of Lung segmentation, followed by prediction of diagnosis for the patient. We also highlight regions of the CT scan which are infected. This result can also be used to aid the radiologist for any further examination.
